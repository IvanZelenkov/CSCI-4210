GoodBuy is a web application that will help retail shoppers find the best prices for the products they need.
The application is not a purchasing platform itself, but rather a tool for keeping shopping trips organizedâ€”whether
online or in-store. Online shoppers can use GoodBuy to sort their shopping list by deals or shipping fees,
while in-store shoppers can use the website to organize their list by promotions, travel time, or both.
GoodBuy will not only help shoppers compare prices across brands, but also help them save on gas and time
whenever they need to shop!
